/**
 * We can formalize this insight a bit. Given an impure function f of type A => B, we can split f into two functions:
 *
 *   - A pure function of type A => D, where D is some description of the result of f.
 *   - An impure function of type D => B, which can be thought of as an interpreter of these descriptions.
 *
 *
 *  It turns out that even procedures like println are doing more than one thing.
 *  And they can be factored in much the same way, by introducing a new data type that weâ€™ll call IO
 *
 *  -The meaning is that println indeed does a lot of things which end with the actual side effects, "printing to the console".
 *   See Internal of Println.
 *
 *  -"And they can be factored in much the same way" i.e. the pure part and the impure part.
 *
 *  This is weird but we can think of it as stating what needs to happen and actually manipulating the console.
 *  It is like putting together what needs to happen, and actually making it happen.
 *
 *  But the example and explanation is weird because then we keep println. We just create something that describe what needs to happens,
 *  and when run, execute the side effect. But if println was doing both things already, then we have done nothing but create a structure that reproduce / mimic
 *  what println does internally and putting some actual control into it.
 *
 *  So if internally, println put together a description of what needs to happen, before executing something that make it happen,
 *  With that structure, we implement that ability to put together what needs to happen and have some control on it and when things will happen ultimately.
 *
 *  Yes a description of what needs to happen is a value and not the effect.
 *
 *
 *  "All it has given us is the ability to delay when something happen"
 *
